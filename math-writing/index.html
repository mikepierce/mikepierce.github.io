    <h2 class="center">Mike Pierce</h2>
    <h4 class="center">Abstract</h4>
    <p>
        This page has two purposes: 
        to serve as a general tutorial on how one can publish mathematical content on webpages,
        and also to showcase <a href=""><code>math-writing.css</code></a>. 
        math-writing.css provides CSS classes that emulate
        some of nice theorem-like environments you can create in LaTeX 
        using the <a target="_blank" href="https://ctan.org/pkg/amsthm?lang=en">amsthm</a> package.
        This, in conjunction with <a href="">MathJax</a>,
        makes writing mathematics on a website straightforward.
        My hope is that providing this will encourage mathematicians 
        to stop using WordPress blogs that are clunky and display mathematics poorly, 
        and to stop typing up useful expository writing as a PDF, 
        which is harder for search engines to index and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://wp.wwu.edu/webtech/accessible-pdf/">notably harder to make accessible than content on a webpage</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I should separate the exposition from the actual guide?
    </p>
    <p>
    Ams.css or something like it?

    <h2>Installing and Using <code>math-writing.css</code></h2>
    <p>
        I assume most academic mathematicians have access
        to a basic website through their institution.
        To use MathWriting.css
    </p>
    <p>
        Then to see the HTML markup for how I'm using MathWriting.css,
        you can view the source of this webpage.
        If you're using Google Chrome ...
        If you're using Firefox ...
        If you're using Safari ...
    </p>

    <h2>Features of MathWriting.css</h2>
    <p>
    GO DIG IN MY research page to SEE WHAT I NEED TO INCLDUE HERE
    </p>
    <div class="theorem">
        There once was a man from Nantucket.
    </div>
    <div class="proof">
        <p>
        Here is the proof of that last claim.
        Here is the proof of that last claim.
        Here is the proof of that last claim.
        Here is the proof of that last claim.
        Here is the proof of that last claim.
        Here is the proof of that last claim.

    <p>
        Then of course any good mathematical writing 
        tells the reader to do some exercises to solidify their understanding.
        You can write 
    </p>
    <ol class="exercises">
        <li> This is an exercise. </li>
        <li> This is another exercise. </li>
        <li> Does math look dumb now? $f(x) = 3x^2+C$</li>
        <li> 
            This is an exercise that has a bunch of parts. 
            <ol>
                <li> This is just part of an exercise </li>
                <li> Here's a second part! </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="hard"> This is a hard exercise with a star next to it.</li>
        <li class="hardhard"> This is an even harder exercise!</li>
    </ol>

    <details class="problem-solution">
        <summary>
            Here's an exercise that has a solution on this page,
            but the solution is hidden until the exercise is clicked.
        </summary>
        <p>
            ahHA! Here is the solution!
            Yep you've just gotta click in the problem to reveal the solution.
        </p>
    </details>

    <h2>Mathematical Notation with MathJax</h2>
    <p>
        This is the same thing MathOverflow uses.
    </p>
    <p>
        One major limitation of MathJax though&mdash;really a
        limitation of all the means of typing mathematics on a webpage 
        that I've listed&mdash;is that you can't create <i>sophisticated</i>
        commutative diagrams.
        ...
    </p>

    <h2>Commutative Diagrams</h2>
    <p>
        AMSCD
    </p>
    <p>
        There's not yet a nice way to do this.
        I've used this trick of exporting it from LaTeX...
    </p>

    <h2>Add Comments to Your Webpage</h2>
    <p>
        I said I want mathematicians to ditch WordPress,
        so I should explain how one can add comments to their webpage.
        To do this by yourself you'd have to have a database running on the server 
        to keep track of the all the comments.
        So instead, to keep things easy, I'd recommend using a third-party service like 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/">htmlcommentbox.com</a>
        or <a target="blank" href="https://www.brianshim.com/webtricks/add-a-comment-wall-to-your-website/">or any of the others listed here</a>.
        Below I'm using ... so you can leave comments on this page. :) 
    </p>
    <p>
        Or just make a twitter link ...
